# An attempt to automate some things in my apartment

## Motivation:
I needed to ration my power usage because of poor power supply where I live(0hrs/day).
To address this, I generate power using solar but its configuration is not enough and I needed to power my fridge and rechargable fan, particularly during the day when there's sunlight. 

However, there's an issue with that, I am always at work during that period, hence the automation.
